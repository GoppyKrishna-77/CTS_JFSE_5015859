Exercise 1: Inventory Management System

1. Understand the Problem
o	Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.

Data structures and algorithms are critical in handling large inventories because they allow efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. For a warehouse inventory management system, choosing the right data structure ensures quick access to product information, minimizes memory usage, and allows for fast updates. Efficient algorithms optimize these operations, reducing the time and computational resources required, which is essential for maintaining a responsive and scalable system.

o	Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.

HashMap: Provides constant-time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations, making it ideal for quickly accessing products by their IDs.

ArrayList: Useful if you need to maintain an ordered list of products and don't require constant-time operations for insertion and deletion.



4. Analysis
o	Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.

Add Product: O(1) in average case using HashMap, as it allows constant-time insertion.

Update Product: O(1), since checking for the existence of a product and updating it is constant-time in HashMap.

Delete Product: O(1), as removing a product using its ID is also a constant-time operation in HashMap.

o	Discuss how you can optimize these operations.

To further optimize the inventory management system we can use the following techniques:

Batch Operations: Implement batch updates or deletions to reduce the overhead of multiple operations.

Lazy Loading: Use lazy loading for product details that aren't immediately necessary, reducing the initial data load.

Concurrency Control: For large-scale systems, use concurrent data structures to handle multiple operations simultaneously without locking, thereby improving performance in multi-threaded environments.
